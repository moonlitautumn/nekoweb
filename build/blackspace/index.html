                what is the point of this place? nobody knows. 
                its empty of any sort of content or anything of meaning but it still exists, 
                maybe it just exists as a place of refuge, a place of peace where nothing matters.
                or maybe its a canvas to be painted, the void to be filled with a part of a humans 
                soul. 
                either way the void only exists because you observe it, once you leave this place 
                it will be destroyed just to be created again on your next visit.
