                i think i accidentally put my friends down by rambling about computers 
                or programming and im genuinely so so sorry, i NEVER meant to make any 
                of you feel inferior im sorry.
            </p>
            <p>
                please dont put me down every chance you get as revenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                anyways, to ######, 
                it was wrong to put you down even if it was on accident, but trying
                to make me feel inferior every moment just makes you even more of 
                an asshole, if you feel atacked by this feel free to text me. lyyy 
            </p>
