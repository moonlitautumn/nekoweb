                    i went to ### today, i realllly hoped i didnt have to but if i 
                didnt go #### would get mad at me, maybe once i switch to the 
                web dev course it will be fun.. for now though i just have to 
                endure it for a bit longer.

                    for whatever reason i feel like my friendships are collapsing
                i know people have other stuff to do and get busy sometimes but its 
                just scary yk.
