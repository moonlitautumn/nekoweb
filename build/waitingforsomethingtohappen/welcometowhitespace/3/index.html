                my laptop literally kill itself and had a kernel panic while i was asleep and like i 
                didnt know how to fix it so i had to reinstall my entire os. it was excrutiating 
                expecially because i had plans on stuff to add to my website agsdghasgkdagdajshdg
            </p>

                at least it didnt take too long to reinstall though! (i cried like 6 times and 
                wanted to ####.) plus i can do stuff now that its working.
            </p>
