                tomorrow i'll finish playing all the games ive been meaning to finish.. but then what?
                i cant find anything interesting, there are no youtubers making modern omori or oneshot 
                content, it feels like all the streamers i used to watch just suddenly dissapeared into
                the soulless content slop that is the modern internet.
            </p>
            <p>
                im tired, i really am, i dont want to go to **** anymore, whats the point im not passing 
                anyways, i want to enjoy my last year before being an adult by acting my age, like a kid, 
                but the things i liked a year or two ago have changed and morphed past recognition, what 
                happened? 
            </p>
            <p>
                sorry for rambling, im exhausted of this.. i dont want to be an adult.
            </p>
