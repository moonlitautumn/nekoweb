                #### is feeling suicidal and i cand help at all, i wish i could just go to their 
                house, give them a hug, order some food and assure them that everything will be 
                okay but we live in diferent continents. it hurts me so so much to know there is 
                nothing i can do to help.
            </p>
            <p>
                also i need to learn to say no, like i should prioritize myself and my own comfor over 
                making ## happy because if i dont i WILL end up with more trauma than i had before.
            </p>
            <P>
