                this might sound really weird but i think i have a monthly cycle..
		like ive been tracking it for MONTHS and for some reason my mood just dips for no reason every ~26ish days, like i'll be full on wanting to *** and staying in bed all day just to feel fine 4-5 days later.
		AND THEN i'll be feeling horny/ kinda confident??? like 5 days after :sob: 
            </p>
	    <p>
		its kinda euthoric cuz like im trans but i think im going insane...
