      		<description>
				<p>
					basically there is this new trend on tt where people are acting like its 2020, and likee bringing back 
               	 	the weirdcore/ glitchcore pfps and the 120fps anime edits and the like tripple screen irl animation memes 
                	and that makes me SO HAPPY!!
            	</p> 
            	<p>
                	pleaseeeeeeeeee last more than a week :sob:
            	</p>
            	<p>
                	oh also i finished watching squid game s2 and it srs made me want to jump off a building, like no joke i was SUFFERINGG 
                	the only good thing that came from it is that 120 is an absolute girlboss and survived *it*
            	</p>
