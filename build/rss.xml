      		<title>squid game and 2020</title>
      		<description>
					basically there is this new trend on tt where people are acting like its 2020, and likee bringing back 
               	 	the weirdcore/ glitchcore pfps and the 120fps anime edits and the like tripple screen irl animation memes 
                	and that makes me SO HAPPY!!

                	pleaseeeeeeeeee last more than a week :sob:

                	oh also i finished watching squid game s2 and it srs made me want to jump off a building, like no joke i was SUFFERINGG 
                	the only good thing that came from it is that 120 is an absolute girlboss and survived *it*

                	I SWEAR IF SHE DIES IN S3 THOUGH
