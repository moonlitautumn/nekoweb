                this will probablyyyy be a pretty short blog post buuuut..

                DRAWING TABLETS ARE THE BEST 

                like literally way better than mice in like literally every single way and for basically any application (well if you ignore gaming that is...) 
                likee the amount of fine control and mobility you get is honestly unmatched its like WAY easier to use a drawing tablet while in bed than a mouse lol

                alsooooooo unrelated but.. stomach book S2S2S2 I LOVE HER SONGS SO SO MUCH AAAAAA

      		<title>squid game and 2020</title>
      		<description>
					basically there is this new trend on tt where people are acting like its 2020, and likee bringing back 
               	 	the weirdcore/ glitchcore pfps and the 120fps anime edits and the like tripple screen irl animation memes 
                	and that makes me SO HAPPY!!

                	pleaseeeeeeeeee last more than a week :sob:

                	oh also i finished watching squid game s2 and it srs made me want to jump off a building, like no joke i was SUFFERINGG 
                	the only good thing that came from it is that 120 is an absolute girlboss and survived *it*

                	I SWEAR IF SHE DIES IN S3 THOUGH
